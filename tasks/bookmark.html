        Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African
        former international cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de
        Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during
        his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden
        cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[2] He is regarded as one of
        the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as the best
        batsman of his era.[3][4] de Villiers began his international career as
        a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a
        batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but
        predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most
        innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is
        known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the
        wicket-keeper.[5] He made his international debut in a Test match
        against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI)
        in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006.
        He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the
        very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms
        of the game.[6] In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[7]
        He holds the record for the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls.
